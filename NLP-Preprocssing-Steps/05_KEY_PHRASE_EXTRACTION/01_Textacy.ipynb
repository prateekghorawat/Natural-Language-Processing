Component\n","\n","In spaCy, the \"parser\" is a key component of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline. It is responsible for analyzing the grammatical structure of a sentence, identifying parts of speech, and building syntactic dependency trees. This analysis is crucial for various NLP tasks.\n","\n","The parser is used for:\n","\n","1. **Dependency Parsing**: Identifying grammatical relationships between words, such as subject-verb relationships, object dependencies, and modifiers.\n","2. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Detecting and categorizing named entities like names of people, places, organizations, etc.\n","3. **Constituency Parsing**: Breaking down a sentence into grammatical constituents like noun phrases and verb phrases.\n","\n","When working with spaCy, you can disable the parser component if you don't need grammatical analysis in your NLP tasks. This can help improve processing speed for tasks like tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, or named entity recognition.\n","\n","To disable the parser, you can use the `disable` parameter when loading a spaCy language model. For example:\n","\n","```python\n","en = load_spacy_lang(\"en_core_web_lg\", disable=(\"parser\"))\n"],"metadata":{"id":"2M9J-DEDRD78"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["doc = make_spacy_doc(text , lang = en)"],"metadata":{"id":"3e3APvlZRXO6"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["tr = textrank(doc , normalize = \"lemma\" , topn = 5)"],"metadata":{"id":"DVzRgoBqRiDX"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["sg = sgrank(doc , topn=5)"],"metadata":{"id":"cEZjrJdqR6xr"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"5JJKKu7nSZ_3"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
