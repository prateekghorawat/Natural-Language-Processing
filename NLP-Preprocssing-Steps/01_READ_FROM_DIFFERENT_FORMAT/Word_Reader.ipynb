Overall, from a business’s standpoint, the commonly seen text data is of the following types.Customer reviews/commentsUser comments are a very common source of text, especially from social media, e-commerce, and hospitality businesses that collect product reviews. For instance, Google and Yelp collect reviews across brands as well as small and large businesses.Social media/blog postsSocial media posts and blogs ﬁnd presence in most types of businesses. In today’s world, social media reaches more people globally than any other form of media.
